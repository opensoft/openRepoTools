"""`--install`'s three artifacts that are not one of the nine files.

lane-collision-protocol Amendment 9(b), inheriting A8 Addendum 2's R-A8-5
unvaried — the skill into the SHARED skills directory every profile reads
through its own symlink, a copy into `~/.claude` for a bare `claude` run
outside the launcher, and ONE merged entry in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

WHY THE HOOK IS THE HARD ONE, and why most of this file is about it. Every
other thing `--install` places is a whole file, so "already there and
identical" is a `cmp`. The hook is one entry inside a file somebody else owns
and two other programs also write, and its ONLY idempotence is an exact match
on the command string. So the tests below are about the four answers that
string can have — present, absent, differing, unreadable — and about the one
rule that makes a wrong answer survivable: the merge is computed with the nine
files in hand, BEFORE any of them is placed, so a refusal costs a whole install
rather than half of one.

NO NETWORK: every run here is from the checkout, so nothing is fetched at all.
